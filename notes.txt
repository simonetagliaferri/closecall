Uso la libreria gson per gestire la dipendenza su fs con json.


Aggiustare le GUI per usare sempre lo styling CSS, cos√¨ da non mischiare styling diretto nell'FXML con del css.


addTournament.fxml sistemare l'allineamento verticale di label e hyperlink della estimated end date.

date validations (start after signup deadline and so on) in tournament bean is not great, should be done in the application controller or even in the model, I still don't know.

Having host and player extend user make it so that there is data duplication (at least the email if we keep the password null) in persistence.

Moved from having host reference in tournament to having club reference. Review add tournament stuff because for now I have that getClub in the logic controller
gets the clubs[0] of that host, need to update the flow to have at first the host select what club he wants to host the tournament at.

Thinking about having different maps for each in memory dao to have multiple indexes to search more efficiently.

Thinking about having repositories to make DAOs interact, that means calling one DAO and use the result to call another. I don't  know if it's better to do that
in a repository or inside the application controller.

I need to add checks on clubs info(street, number, city, state, country, phone, email) and on invite info(email address, expire date<=signup deadline)

Made it so when sending an email to an unregistered player, username and email are set to the email address so that the key in the users map(Username) is not null.
To make this always work, I need to make it so that during sign up the username and the email can't match.

Edit DAO calls to only pass the needed attributes, not the full domain models, so that there is higher coesion and lower coupling.
