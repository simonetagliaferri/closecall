Uso la libreria gson per gestire la dipendenza su fs con json.


Aggiustare le GUI per usare sempre lo styling CSS, cos√¨ da non mischiare styling diretto nell'FXML con del css.


addTournament.fxml sistemare l'allineamento verticale di label e hyperlink della estimated end date.

date validations (start after signup deadline and so on) in tournament bean is not great, should be done in the application controller or even in the model, I still don't know.

Having host and player extend user make it so that there is data duplication (at least the email if we keep the password null) in persistence.

Moved from having host reference in tournament to having club reference. Review add tournament stuff because for now I have that getClub in the logic controller
gets the clubs[0] of that host, need to update the flow to have at first the host select what club he wants to host the tournament at.

Thinking about having different maps for each in memory dao to have multiple indexes to search more efficiently.
